In this block you can change all the parameters of the system. Use the sliders to change stuff like mass, friction, gravity, etc.\

Here you can select the input you want to use in the system.<br><br> Leave it blank to give arbitrary input by dragging the mouse on the system.\

Click here to start the simulation \

Reset everything (basically reloads the page)\

This is a special control mechanism that requires a external client. This is used to allow an external program to control the system via WebSocket. More info later...\

Here you can check the current time, amplitude and frequency of the input signal applied to the system\

Here you can change how the system is renderized. Each one adds some level of detail and representation.\

    showHelp($('#systemCanvas'), '\
Here is the main canvas. You can interact with the system and see its simulation according to the level of detailed chosen on display options.<br><br>\
<ul>\
<li>Drag the mouse left - right to change in the input signal amplitude. Depending on the system this corresponds to different actions. For mechanical systems, this corresponds to drag the position of apply a force, for instance. </li>\
<li>If you have some input, dragging horizontally will increase the frequency of that input and dragging vertically will change its amplitude</li>\
<li>For 3D rendering, use the mouse wheels to change the angle of the camera. Wheel vertically to change angle and horizontally to change tilt. Control-wheel to zoom in or out</li>\
<li>In general, colors are representative. If a block is red, the variable corresponding to it will be shown in red in the plot</li>\
</ul>\

This is the main oscilloscope. Here you can see the plot for the dynamical variables of the system. Colors in general match the canvas elements. A blue plot will represent the value of a blue element in the system representation\
